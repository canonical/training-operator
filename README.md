# Training Operator

[![CharmHub Badge](https://charmhub.io/training-operator/badge.svg?channel=1.6/stable)](https://charmhub.io/training-operator?channel=1.6/stable)

## Overview

This repository hosts the Kubernetes Training Operator for Kubeflow training jobs.

## Description

The [Kubeflow Training Operator][1] provides Kubernetes custom resources to run distributed or
non-distributed training jobs, such as TFJobs and PytorchJobs. The Training Operator in this
repository is a Python script which wraps the latest released Kubeflow Training Operator
[manifests][2], providing lifecycle management and handling events (install, upgrade, integrate,
remove). It is one of the [Charmed Kubeflow][3] operators.

## Usage

While it is possible to deploy the Training Operator as a standalone operator, it works best when
deployed alongside other components included in the Kubeflow bundle. For installation steps, please
refer to the [installation][4] guide.
